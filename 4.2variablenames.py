#Multi Words Variable Names
#Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
#There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

#Camel Case
#Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariableName = "John"

#Pascal Case
#Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "John"

#Snake Case
#Each word is separated by an underscore character:
my_variable_name = "John"
