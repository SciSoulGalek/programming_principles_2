x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)
#automatic sep = " "

x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)
#concatenation 

#In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
#Right way
